TEST TASKS

IMPORTANT 

-tasks must be documented as if it was a programming tasks (documented for programmers)</br>
-task must be implemented with Go and GIT</br>
-task MUST include commits for every logical block of work. It is expected to have frequent commits with meaningful messages, preferably multiple commits per-function.
  as a solution submit your Git repo URL

STRING SPECS

Given a string that is a sequence of numbers followed by dash followed by text, eg: 23-ab-48-caba-56-haha

-The numbers can be assumed to be unsigned integers</br>
-The strings can be assumed to be ASCII sequences of arbitrary length larger than 0 (empty strings not allowed).</br>

TASK 1

-Before implementing the needed function, please estimate the difficulty of the functions and report the estimated and the used time to implement the functions in the function comment block.</br>
-Write a function testValidity that takes the string as an input, and returns boolean flag true if the given string complies with the format, or false if the string does not comply</br>
-Write a function averageNumber that takes the string, and returns the average number from all the numbers</br>
-Write a function wholeStory that takes the string, and returns a text that is composed from all the text words separated by spaces, e.g. story called for the string 1-hello-2-world should return text: "hello world"</br>
-Write a function storyStats that returns four things:
	-the shortest word</br>
	-the longest word</br>
	-the average word length</br>
	-the list (or empty list) of all words from the story that have the length the same as the average length rounded up and down.

TASK 2

Before implementing the needed function, please estimate the difficulty of the functions and report the estimated and the used time to implement the functions in the function comment block.
Write a generate function, that takes boolean flag and generates random correct strings if the parameter is true and random incorrect strings if the flag is false.
Write unit tests for the functions:

 -testValidity</br>
 -averageNumber</br>
 -wholeStory</br>
 -storyStats`
